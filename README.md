ZENO VX - Multiverse Erasure
ZENO VX is a powerful Denial of Service (DoS) tool designed for Linux Ubuntu environments. It combines multiple flooding techniques inspired by various well-known DoS tools to deliver a robust and multi-faceted attack capability. This project is intended for educational purposes and cybersecurity research only.
Features
 * Multi-Method Attack: Integrates TCP, UDP, HTTP, and SYN flood capabilities for comprehensive DoS attacks.
 * IP Spoofing: Includes a built-in IP spoofer to randomize source IPs for HTTP requests, enhancing anonymity during attacks.
 * User-Agent Randomization: Utilizes a list of common user agents to make HTTP traffic appear more legitimate.
 * High Concurrency: Employs multi-threading to launch a high volume of concurrent attack requests.
 * Ubuntu Optimized: Specifically designed and tested for Linux Ubuntu environments.
 * Stealth Mode: Implements features aimed at making the attack more evasive.

I am not responsible for any misuse or damage caused by this program. This tool is provided "as is" and without any warranty. By using this software, you agree to assume full responsibility for your actions. Unauthorized DoS attacks are illegal and can lead to severe penalties.
How it Works
ZENO VX operates by continuously sending a large volume of network packets or requests to a specified target IP/host. It leverages various protocols and techniques to overwhelm the target's resources, aiming to disrupt its services.
 * TCP Flood: Establishes and quickly closes numerous TCP connections, exhausting target resources.
 * UDP Flood: Sends a massive amount of UDP packets, consuming bandwidth and processing power.
 * HTTP Flood: Dispatches a high volume of HTTP GET requests, simulating legitimate web traffic to overload web servers.
 * SYN Flood: Initiates numerous partial TCP connections (SYN packets) to fill up the target's connection table.
Getting Started
Prerequisites
 * Linux Ubuntu Operating System
 * Python 3.x installed
cd ZENO-VX

 * Make the script executable:
   chmod +x zeno_vx.py

Usage
Run the script from your terminal:
python3 zeno_vx.py

The script will then prompt you to enter the target IP/Host.
